<h3>New Window</h3>
Opens another independent ProfileViewer window.

<h3>Load...</h3>
Opens the FileDialog to let you choose a profile file to load. Note that if
you change directories with this dialog and you have not modified the
<a href="#classpath">classpath</a> environment variable, the java interpreter
will start generating exceptions.

<h3>Close Window</h3>
Closes the current window. If the last open window is closed, the VM is quit.

<h3>About...</h3>
Displays a dialog box with contact information for Greg and myself.
Greg no longer works on PV, so while you can certainly send thanks to him,
any questions about the latest versions should be sent to me.

<h3>Help...</h3>
Displays this file in a separate window.

<h3>License...</h3>
Displays the GNU General Public License under which ProfileViewer is released.

<h3>Exit</h3>
Closes the application

<hr>
<h2><a name="ref method">Method Menu</a></h2>
<h3>Sort...</h3>
Brings up the sort dialog to let you sort the methods.
<h3>Find...</h3>
Brings up the find dialog.
<h3>Find next</h3>
Repeats the last find.

<h3>Go To Callee</h3>
"Goes to" the currently selected callee. Makes the currently selected callee
the currently selected method so that you can see its callees and callers.
<h3>Sort Callee...</h3>
Brings up the sort dialog to let you sort the callees.

<h3>Go To Caller</h3>
"Goes to" the currently selected caller. Makes the currently selected caller
the currently selected method so that you can see its callees and callers.
<h3>Sort Caller...</h3>
Brings up the sort dialog to let you sort the callers.

<h2><a name="ref options">Options Menu</a></h2>
<h3>Exclude Methods</h3>
Brings up a dialog that lets you exclude methods from being displayed in
the list. This can be useful for large profile files, which can contain
lots of method calls in which the user is not interested.<BR>
Clicking on the "Add" Button adds a new entry to the exclusion list.
Enter a string, which will be matched against the beginning of the
method call; if there is a match, the method will not be displayed.
Note that package names are displayed as, e.g., "java/lang", not 
"java.lang". Entering "javax/swing" will prevent all Swing methods from
being displayed, entering "java" will suppress all java.* and javax.*
methods. Individual methods ("java/lang/StringBuffer/append") can be
entered as well. This only affects the display, not the calculations.<BR>
Note that now the percentages won't add up to 100% any more. If you want
only the displayed method to figure into the percentage calculation,
check the "Percentages add up to 100%" check box.<BR>
If you check the "is Regexp" check box next to the match string,
regular expression matching will be used instead of plain string 
comparison. Note that this matches anywhere, not just at the beginning
of a method name, as the normal string search does.<BR>
Clicking "Delete" removes the currenty selected entry from the list.
<BR>Can also be set at startup via the <code>ProfileViewer.methodsToExclude</code>
and the <code>ProfileViewer.percentagesAddTo100</code> properties.

<h3>Show Numbers as Percent</h3>
Toggles between the display of absolute numbers and percentages as described
in the section about <a href="#windows">the screen</a>.
If you exclude methods, percentages will add up to 100% only if you check
the respective check box in the Exclude dialog.<BR>
This used to be called "Toggle Numbers"; by default it still displays percentages.
<BR>Can also be set at startup via the <code>ProfileViewer.showNumbersPercent</code> property.

<h3>Include Callee Times</h3>
The time spent in a method that are reported in the profiling output include the
time spent in all subroutines called from that method. Sometimes it's more 
interesting to know the time spent exclusively in a method, w/o the subroutines.
In that case, uncheck this option and reload the profile. This option is
set by default (which corresponds to the way ProfileViewer used to work).
<BR>Can also be set at startup via the <code>ProfileViewer.includeCalleeTimes</code> property.

<h3>Decode Method Names</h3>
Displays the method names the way they are defined, with the parameters and
return types in clear text, e.g. <code>java/lang/Double.doubleToLongBits(double): long</code>
instead of <code>java/lang/Double.doubleToLongBits(D)J</code>.
This option is set by default.
<BR>Can also be set at startup via the <code>ProfileViewer.decodeMethodNames</code> property.

<h3>Add Method to Callees</h3>
Adds the selected method to the list of its callees. That way one can see
(in percent mode) how much time is spent in the method itself, compared to the callees.
This option is not set by default.
<BR>Can also be set at startup via the <code>ProfileViewer.addSelfToCallees</code> property.

<h3>Use AWT File Dialog</h3>
If this menu item is checked, ProfileViewer will use an AWT FileDialog 
instead of a Swing JFileChooser for the "Load..." dialog. I've come to find
the Swing dialog annoying, mostly because it's slow and sorts the files
in a case-sensitive way, but that's a personal preference.
This option is not set by default.
<BR>Can also be set at startup via the <code>ProfileViewer.useAWTFileDialog</code> property.

<h3>Use Browser for Help</h3>
This option is applicable to Mac users only, who are running at least MRJ version 2.2.
If set, the user's preferred browser is used to display the documentation 
under the "Profile/Help..." menu, instead of the much slower Swing HTML viewer.
This option is set by default.
<BR>Can also be set at startup via the <code>ProfileViewer.useBrowserForHelp</code> property.

<h3>Exclude Recursive Calls</h3>
When set, recursive method calls (i.e., a method calling itself) are ignored.
Profiling data is sometimes flaky for recursive calls. The switch only works
for direct recursion, not for indirect recursion.
This option is not set by default; in contrast to all other options, it does
not affect loaded profiles, only ones loaded after the option has been changed.
<BR>Can also be set at startup via the <code>ProfileViewer.excludeRecursiveCalls</code> property.
