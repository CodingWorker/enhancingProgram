Thanks to David Moore for the tip.</ul><BR><dt><em>May 1, 1996 (GW)</em></dt><dd><ul><li>Added Jars top 5% logo and Gamelan cool applet logo &lt;grin&gt;.</ul></dd><BR><dt><em>May 2, 1996 (GW)</em></dt><dd><ul><li>Added support for displaying values as percentages and made that the default mode.<li>Added the status line at the bottom to display a whole method name.</ul></dd><BR><dt><em>May 28, 1996 (GW)</em></dt><dd><ul><li>Added note that this does not currently work with JDK 1.0.2.</ul><BR><dt><em>May 30, 1996 (GW)</em></dt><dd><ul><li>Made fix available to support JDK 1.0.2 or earlier. The format of thejava.prof file had changed with the release of JDK 1.0.2.</ul></dd><BR><dt><em>July 19, 1996 (GW)</em></dt><dd><ul><li>Fixed behavior when <code>&lt;unknown caller&gt;</code> and similar namesare found. Previously, because the code tokenizes based on spaces, it wouldsilently stop processing partway through the file, causing an incorrect display.<p>The code now recognizes the less-than and greater-than signs in callee andcaller names as indicating spaces are allowed. Additionally, if unexpectedprocessing errors are encountered, ProfileViewer will now dump an exception.<p>Thanks to W. Brian Blevins for finding and reporting the bug!</ul><BR><dt><em>August 12, 1996 (GW)</em></dt><dd><ul><li>I fixed a bug that caused an unhandled exception when a listbox was double-clicked on.<li>I incorporated a tip from Craig Hughes to call requestFocus twiceto get around a bug in AWT. It does not appear to help in Windows 95, butperhaps it does on other platforms.</ul></dd><BR><dt><em>January 30, 1999 (version 0.94, GW)</em></dt><dd><ul><li>I released this program under the GNU General Public License.</ul></dd><BR><dt><em>February 6, 1999 (version 0.95, first version by UD)</em></dt><dd><ul>	<li> Now uses Sun's Collections package instead of Doug Lea's	<li> Added the "Method Exclusion" option 	<li> The AWT interface has been replaced by a Swing 1.1 UI	<li> Deprecated Java 1.0 methods have been eliminated. The Java 1.1 event model is now used.</ul><BR><dt><em>November 28, 2000 (version 0.96, UD)</em></dt><dd><ul>	<li> regular expressions can now be used in the Find and Exclude dialogs,	courtesy of the gnu.regexp package	<li> sorting is now case-insensitive	<li> added option to have percentages still add up to 100 if methods are excluded	<li> added Help dialog that displays this file	<li> the panels are now labeled to make it clear which column displays what	<li> added option to use AWT FileDialog instead of Swing JFileChooser	<li> incorporated enhancements by Ype Kingma,   e.g. the idea to exclude times spent in subroutines from being counted in the main routine. Thanks!	<li> fixed bugs related to excluding functions from display	<li> reorganized the source code	<li> the Collections and Regexp packages are now part of the distribution	<li> added capability to open several profile windows at the same time	<li> added section on <a HREF="index.html#programmatically">controlling the 	profiler programmatically</a> to this document</ul></dd><BR><a name="12_3_00"><dt><em>December 3, 2000 (version 0.96.1, UD)</em></dt><dd><ul>	<li> added menu for choosing betwen Swing LAFs; for MacOS and Windows it defaults	to the native look. Thanks for the suggestion to Stuart Roebuck.	<li> made AWT-or-Swing file chooser a global setting	<li> added runit.bat to zip file (was missing in 0.96)	<li> removed special Java2 distribution, since the standard one works fine</ul></dd><BR><a name="4_14_01"><dt><em>April 14, 2001 (version 1.0b2, UD)</em><BR>This version incorporates substantial improvements by Carsten Heyl and Luc Maisonobe.<BR>Many thanks to them for their contributions!</dt><dd><ul>   <li> recursive profile entries are ignored (not totally sure about that but my numbers look okay) (CH)   <li> toggling the "Include Callee Times" option now affects the display    immediately, w/o the need to reload the profile (CH)	<li> warns about turning off the 'Percentages add up to 100%' option when 	'Include Callee Times' is selected, because otherwise the numbers don't make much sense   <li> method signatures are decoded for readability (can be switched on/off at runtime) (CH)   <li> when in percent mode the callee times are printed as <BR>           %time relative to time of method (%time relative to program time) <BR>         This makes sense because you see at first glance where the total time of the method is spent			and the time in parentheses gives a feeling of whether the percentage is 			significant to the overall program runtime. (CH)   <li> the method itself is added to the callees window, too, so that one can see (in percent mode)          how much time is spent in the method itself compared to the callees (CH)   <li> a Makefile for unix has been added (CH)	<li> added a fallback for the help dialog in case the HTML file is not available (LM)	<li> a UNIX shell wrapper has been added (LM)	<li> a spec file for RPM (RedHat Package Manager) has been added (LM)	<li> capability to handle different profile file formats (LM)	<li> a parser for gprof output has been added (to handle C/C++/fortran programs)	Currently, both the GNU and the Solaris gprof formats are handled.(LM)	<li> fixed a problem where the JBound app for MRJ would not find the included jar files	<li> upgraded to version 1.1.1 of the GNU regexp package	<li> All Swing Look-And-Feel (LAF) packages are picked up automatically. 	It is no longer necessary to change the source code for additional packages to be	recognized if they are installed system-wide via the <code>swing.properties</code> file.	<li> The various switches in the Profile menu can be set using properties.	All properties are read from the file <code>ProfileViewer.properties</code> if present at startup.	There are also properties for the preferred LAF and for prepopulating the exclude dialog.	<li> When using the Swing file chooser, a "Find file" accessory has been added.	It's mostly a rip-off of JavaWorlds <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/javatips/jw-javatip93.html">	Java Tip 93</a>. By default it's disabled (but can be turned on in the Options menu),	because I haven't had much luck with it under MRJ. Under Windows JDK 1.3 it works fine, though.	<li> Finally bumped the version number to 1.0 (beta 2, that is). That's more out 	of a desire to get to a more standard versioning scheme than anything else.	<li> Instead of a Swing dialog, the user's preferred browser can be used to open the documentation	in the "Profile/Help..." menu.

This will be the last release on my watch - from here onI'll no longer add anything new, just fix bugs and incorporate contributions from other people.This shouldn't make a big difference, as it has outlived its usefulness for the most part.<dd><ul>	<li>It is possible to hide the parameters of methods.	<li>The LAF menu of all windows is properly updated when the LAF is changed.	<li>The jRegex package is used instead of GNU RegExp, which is slow and not as feature-rich.	<li>The use of the Java 1.1 Collections classes has been phased out.	<li>An Ant build file has been added.	<li>The code has been cleaned up in a few spots.</ul></dd><BR><a name="3_16_05"><dt><em>March 16, 2005 (version 1.0.1, UD)</em></dt><dd><ul>	<li>Some versions of Suns <code>gprof</code> apparently use plus signs as delimiters;		Guilhem Bonnefille supplied a fix for this.	<li>All files now have Unix-style line endings (newline only), instead of a hodgepodge of Unix, Mac and DOS.	<li>The <code>fixcrlf</code> target in the Ant build file was corrected to include all appropriate files.</ul><BR><a name="4_3_09"><dt><em>April 3, 2009 (version 1.0.2, UD)</em></dt><dd><ul>	<li>Replaced JRegex library by java.util.regex	<li>Removed Look &amp; Feel menu and capability	<li>Some non-functional changes and code cleanup</ul></dd><BR><a name="6_16_09"><dt><em>June 16, 2009 (version 1.0.3, UD)</em></dt><dd><ul>	<li>Added gprof parser for OS X	<li>Removed "Use File Finder" switch; it's always displayed now</ul></dd></dl></body></html>
